(defun read-multiple-choice (prompt choices)
  "Ask user a multiple choice question.
PROMPT should be a string that will be displayed as the prompt.

CHOICES is an alist where the first element in each entry is a
character to be entered, the second element is a short name for
the entry to be displayed while prompting (if there's room, it
might be shortened), and the third, optional entry is a longer
explanation that will be displayed in a help buffer if the user
requests more help.

This function translates user input into responses by consulting
the bindings in `query-replace-map'; see the documentation of
that variable for more information.  In this case, the useful
bindings are `recenter', `scroll-up', and `scroll-down'.  If the
user enters `recenter', `scroll-up', or `scroll-down' responses,
perform the requested window recentering or scrolling and ask
again.

When `use-dialog-box' is t (the default), this function can pop
up a dialog window to collect the user input. That functionality
requires `display-popup-menus-p' to return t. Otherwise, a text
dialog will be used.

The return value is the matching entry from the CHOICES list.

Usage example:

\(read-multiple-choice \"Continue connecting?\"
                      \\='((?a \"always\")
                        (?s \"session only\")
